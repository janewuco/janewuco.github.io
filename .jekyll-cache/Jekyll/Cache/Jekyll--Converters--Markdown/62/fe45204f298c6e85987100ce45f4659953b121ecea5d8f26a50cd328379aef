I"‡<p>Youâ€™ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)
#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</code></pre></figure>
