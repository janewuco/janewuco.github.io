I"È<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">the projectâ€™s readme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [â€¦] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.</p>
