I"6<p>The path that led me here is winding. Born and raised in China, I was trained to be a programmer but did not really enjoy it as I’m more fond of having conversations with people to get inspirations. I started in media, as an intern at Beijing’s Phoenix TV working on social issue documentaries, as a reporter covering fund things in India and South Korea at Financial Times, later as a features editor covering fun stuff and people at ELLE Hong Kong.</p>

<p>These days I find myself in a different career, working on the story-telling side of tech startups, most recently with blockchain project Nervos. I came across crypto in 2017, quite randomly and it’s always happening and I’m still curious and wanted to learn more. I curate a weekly newsletter about crypto China and write here from time to time.</p>
