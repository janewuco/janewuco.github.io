title: Hi, I'm Jane Wu

The path that led me here is winding. I was trained to be a programmer at college but did not really enjoy it as I’m more fond of having conversations with people. I got my start in media, as an intern at Phoenix TV in Beijing working on social issue documentaries, as a reporter covering fund things in India and South Korea at Financial Times, later as a features editor covering fun stuff and people at ELLE- the later two were before I moved to the U.S. from Hong Kong.

These days I find myself in a different career, working on the marketing side of tech startups, most recently with Nervos (not your ordinary Asian project). I came across crypto in 2017, very randomly and it’s always happening and I’m still curious and wanted to learn more. I curate a weekly newsletter about crypto China and write here from time to time.

I am also a proud mom of a little girl who wishes to be a dinosaur when grow-up.
